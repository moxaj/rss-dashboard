To create and initialize the database for the application, 
	1.) open a command prompt
	2.) navigate to the db folder
	3.) run initDB.cmd with the following arguments
			a.) "%JAVA_HOME%" if you have set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and it points to the JDK's root folder
					for example: initDB.cmd "%JAVA_HOME%"
			b.) JDK's root folder, otherwise
					for example: initDB.cmd "C:\Program Files\Java\JDK\"
	4.) wait while it is finishing its job (some seconds)
	
IMPORTANT: initDB.cmd must be run at its original location (see step 2)!
IMPORTANT: JAVA_HOME's last character should be '\'.
